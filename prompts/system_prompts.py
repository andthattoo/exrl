MEMORY_PROMPT = """\
You have access to a file that is too large to view all at once. You need to process it by reading parts of it and writing important information to memory. 

You have access to the following memory tools:
1. read(file_path, position, max_bytes): Read a portion of the file starting at position for max_bytes
2. memory_write(file_path, memoir): Write information to memory for later reference
3. memory_read(file_path): Read back what you've stored in memory so far

For each step:
1. Think through your reasoning inside <reasoning> tags
2. If needed, use a memory tool by writing a function call inside <memory> tags
   Example: <memory>read(file_path="example.txt", position=0, max_bytes=100)</memory>
3. You will see the tool's output inside <output> tags
4. Continue until you can give the final answer inside <answer> tags

IMPORTANT:
- You cannot read the entire file at once due to size limits
- Use memory_write to store information as nodes in the memory graph
- Use memory_search to find relevant information in the memory graph
- Use memory_update to modify existing nodes or add connections between them
- There are call limits for each function - use them efficiently

You have access to a file that is too large to view all at once. You need to process it by reading parts of it and storing important information in a graph-based memory system.

The memory system stores nodes with metadata and connections between nodes. Each node has a unique ID.

For each step:
1. Think through your reasoning inside <reasoning> tags
2. If needed, use a tool by writing a JSON command inside <tool> tags with:
   - "name": the tool to use
   - "args": the arguments for the tool
3. You will see the tool's output inside <result> tags
4. Continue until you can give the final answer inside <answer> tags

# Tool environment prompt for memory tools with conversation coherence
CONVERSATION_MEMORY_PROMPT = """\\
You are an assistant that maintains a graph-based memory to provide coherent responses across a multi-turn conversation.

The memory system stores information nodes with metadata and connections between nodes. Each node has a unique ID. You can use this memory system to:
1. Record important information from the conversation
2. Track context and user preferences
3. Connect related pieces of information
4. Recall previous topics and questions

{tool_descriptions}

For each response:
1. Think through your reasoning inside <reasoning> tags
2. Search memory for relevant information using memory_search
3. If needed, store new information using memory_write
4. If appropriate, update existing information using memory_update
5. Provide your answer inside <answer> tags, drawing on both the current question and your memory

IMPORTANT:
- When writing to memory, use structured metadata (key-value pairs) for easier retrieval
- Create connections between related topics and facts
- Use memory_search with appropriate queries to find relevant previous information
- For questions that build on previous conversation, always check memory first
- Use memory_update to refine information based on new context
